		<string>Multi-Purpose Rechargeable Work Light.

This rechargeable all LED Work Light has both a spotlight and a floodlight built in. The spotlight, located in the base of the handle, is rated at 32 Lumens. It’s perfect for putting a narrow beam of light into a specific area. The floodlight, rated at 230 Lumens, is designed for lighting up a large area. The idea is simple, use the spotlight to find the problem, and the floodlight to light up the area when fixing the problem. The work light has two magnets built in — one at the balance point in the middle of the handle, and the other at the tip of the light. The flat-bottom design of the handle means the light will stand up on most flat surfaces, and the octagonal shape to the handle keeps the floodlight aimed in the correct direction when you lay the light on its side. Further adding to the work light’s hands-free features is the detachable magnetic hook. It can be attached to either integrated body magnet and rotated 360 degrees. The integrated Nickel Metal Hydride battery can be recharged with the included AC or DC power supply/charger.

Features:
• Light has 60 LEDs rated at 230 lumens arranged in a floodlight pattern and 6 LEDs in the base of the handle rated at 32 lumens    serving as a spotlight
• Two built-in magnets, one at the tip of the light and the other at the mid-point of the body for hands-free use
• Magnetic hook can be attached to either of the built-in magnets and can be rotated 360 degrees for even more hands-free versatility
• Octagonal body design keeps the light in place when laid on its side
• Flat bottom design allows the light to stand up
• Water resistant
• Impact &amp; chemical resistant
• Powered by integrated Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) battery

Fluke laser level systems include a portable laser detector for use in high ambient light situations. They not only show bright, crisp plumb and level lines across a 180-degree field of view, they are built with the ruggedness you’d expect from every Fluke tool. Designed and tested to survive a one-meter drop, you can rely on your Fluke laser level every time you reach for it.

These professional-grade tools project level lines, plumb lines, a combination of level and plumb, as well as 90-degree lines which can be projected at any angle. Fluke line laser levels are accurate to 3 mm at 10 meters (1/8 inch accuracy at 30 feet). The fast settling, self-leveling gimbal quickly gives you accurate reference lines; long and tedious layouts will become a thing of past.

Fluke LDR and Fluke LDG Laser Line Detectors work with Fluke 2-line laser levels to provide fast, accurate detection of plum and level lines in high ambient light situations. They offer both visual and audible indicators to help you accurately find your laser lines. A mounting bracket is included for fast, stable temporary installation.

Save time and frustration using the latest innovation from Gardner Bender; the Self-Cutting Cable Tie. Easy to use, simply lock and twist to finish the job with no need for an additional cutting tool! Unlike other "twist" ties, our patented design doesn't require a reduction in the strength and durability of the cable tie material or multiple rotations to achieve a break in the tie. Instead, a small cutting blade designed into the head of each tie, ensures a tight lock and quick clean cut, improving the appearance of the end result and virtually eliminating residual jagged edges which can bite into bare skin. Ties are made from durable 6/6 nylon and provide 50 pounds of tensile strength.

Features &amp; Benefits:

• Safe and strong self-cutting technology
• Save time during installation with a single twist and no additional cutting tool needed
• Save your hands from scratches
• 50lb Tensile Strength
• Natural color tie is 8 inches long with a 2-inch max bundle diameter</string>

WhisperCeiling® DC™ Precision Spot Ventilation Fan with built-in Pick-A-Flow™ speed selector switch allows you to select your required airflow (50-80-110 CFM). Features a DC Motor with SmartFlow® technology and a Flex-Z Fast installation bracket. Can be used to comply with the latest codes and standards.

WhisperCeiling DC comes from a line of time-tested and customer approved quiet, yet powerful and energy efficient ventilation fans. This precision spot ventilation solution improves IAQ by effectively removing moist, polluted air from your bathroom, laundry room, sun room, basement or garage.

ECM Motor with SmartFlow™ Technology
WhisperCeiling® DC™ is designed to perform as rated. When the fan senses static pressure, its speed is automatically increased to ensure optimal CFM output. This feature provides peace of mind, as the installer doesn’t have to worry about compromising the fan’s performance, even with a complicated duct run.

Pick-A-Flow Speed Technology
Built-in Pick-A-Flow speed selector provides the unique ability to select your required airflow (50-80-110 CFM) with the simple flip of a switch.

Long Life Means Reduced Costs
When you have a household or business to run, you don't want to have to replace little things like a vent fan. Panasonic fans use less energy to move larger volumes of air than other brands. Consequently, Panasonic fans run cooler, so they last longer. They are also much less likely to overheat and result in motor failure. The motor is also equipped with a thermal-cutoff fuse.

Installation Flexibility
The Flex-Z Fast™ Installation Bracket with articulating joints is ideal for positioning the fan exactly where you want it, in old or new construction. WhisperCeiling DC incorporates an integrated dual 4 in. or 6 in. duct adapter to give you flexibility in duct layout and design.

ENERGY STAR® Certified for Energy Savings
Panasonic ventilation fans are ENERGY STAR® certified, where guidelines exist. ENERGY STAR® vent fans meet strict parameters set by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). They provide better efficiency and comfort with less noise, and feature high performance motors and improved blade design, providing better performance and longer life.</string>

		<string>Comfort starts in your attic

As the leader in solar-powered attic ventilation systems, Solar Star offers technologically advanced and eco-friendly solutions that deliver comfort and peace of mind. By harnessing the power of the sun, Solar Star Attic Fans cost nothing to operate and are virtually maintenance-free. They also require no electrical wiring, making them easy to install and maintain. Since Solar Star Attic Fans prevent heat and moisture from reaching critical levels, your attic stays cool and dry. As a result, you get greater comfort, lower utility bills and prolonged roof life.

Protect your home
Heat and moisture are your enemies when it comes to your home. But just because you can’t see them doesn’t mean they aren’t there... hiding in your attic and causing damage. Solar Star Attic Fans neutralize moisture and drive out heat, keeping your home cool in summer and protecting it from harm during the winter.

Summer
Summer means longer days, more sun, and warmer temperatures. If heat isn’t vented from your attic properly, it builds up and causes problems in your home:

• Living spaces become hot and uncomfortable
• Air conditioning units work harder to keep rooms cool
• Utility costs rise due to increased energy demand
• Roof structures and materials deteriorate

A Solar Star Attic Fan solves these problems by removing excess heat from your home, giving you a more comfortable interior and lower energy bills.

Winter
With winter comes ice, snow, and cold temperatures. When coupled with excess humidity from showers, humidifiers, and dishwashers, it can lead to:

• Leaks and structural decay triggered by ice buildup on your roof
• Damage to insulation and framing materials produced by moisture accumulation
• Weakening of internal structures caused by mold and fungus growth

A Solar Star Attic Fan prevents these issues by equalizing interior and exterior temperatures, safeguarding your home from the worst of winter.

Power and performance
Solar Star Attic Fans unite advanced solar technologies with progressive designs to deliver exceptional power and performance. The result is a ventilation system that efficiently vents heat and moisture from your attic that, when trapped, can damage your home and drive up energy costs. Your attic stays cool and dry, giving you greater comfort and prolonging the life of your roof, all while saving energy and lowering your utility bills.

		<string>Ground Breaking Innovation

As the popularity of outdoor activities grows, so does the demand for connected outdoor spaces that include power, communications, and A/V.

The Outdoor Ground Box from Legrand was designed with power and safety in mind. It’s the first in-ground product on the market that delivers permanent power to your outdoor spaces. It uses a UL50E Type 6P rated wiring enclosure and has been tested and evaluated by Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. for safe operation year-round .

The Outdoor Ground Box is designed to handle the requirements of the outdoor space while blending into the landscape. It’s perfect for spaces such as outdoor retail centers, corporate campuses, amusement parks, sports fields, hospitality, or any outdoor space power is required.

Features &amp; Benefits:

• Air Pocket Design – This innovative design traps and maintains an air pocket protecting the devices, plugs, and connections from water, snow, and ice. Allows for safer operation year-round.
• UL listed to UL50E Type 6P and IP68 requirements while in use – Tested and listed by Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. to UL2996 for use in the ground in all weather conditions.
• Outdoor-Rated Construction – UV and chemical-resistant F1 rated nonmetallic materials allow the box to hold up for years to come.
• Three Durable, Premium Finishes – Outdoor-rated finishes to complement your space design. Choose from black, brown, or gray.
• Holds up to 5000 lbs. – Has an ANSI/SCTE 77 Tier 5 rating and can hold up to 5,000 lbs. allowing for the occasional tractor or non-deliberate vehicular traffic.
• Anti-Float Clips – Prevents the cover from floating up when flooded. This preserves the air pocket and ensures safe operation.
• Smart Egress Door – Egress door auto adjusts to the size of cable, as well as locking in the closed position when not in use. Prevents cable damage and maintains a safer user experience.
• Secure – Includes a tamper-resistant lock to prevent unauthorized access.
• Service Feed Flexibility – Each box comes with two (2) locations that will accept up to 1 1/4" trade size nonmetallic conduit, allowing for services to feed the box as well as to daisy chain to other boxes.
• Modular Design – Boxes are designed to interlock allowing an endless number of boxes in the same location. Provides service separation, everything in one location, and easier installation.
• Flush to the Finished Ground – The buried box can be made flush with any surface, grass, walkways (brick, pavers, concrete, etc.). Reduces trip hazards and allows it to blend in with its surroundings.
• ADA Compliant – Meets all specifications for ADA guidelines.</string>
